CHANGELOG
=========

v0.1.1 (2016-07-24):
	* Attenuate pollution of the command namespace from `qcd`'s helper functions
	  by prefixing them with `__qcd_`.

v0.1.0 (2016-07-22):
	* Initial public release. Shortcuts can be added, changed, and removed using
	  the command instead of having to manually edit the script.

v0.0.1 (2016-07-02):
	* Initial private version. Shortcuts are defined manually in a Bash `case`
	  statement.
